# PyTracker-archive
This is a backup of the games tracked by the PyTracker: https://retro-tracker.game-server.cc/

I've organized them into folders like YYYY/MM to make them easier to browse due to the filename format being game-MM-DD-YYYY-HH-MM-SS-creator-map.html

Someday I will automate a daily backup of it to this repo but for now, enjoy everything from 2024 and before! 
You can expect me to add the files monthly until I revamp how the actual tracker archives games...
